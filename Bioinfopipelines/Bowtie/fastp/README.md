Bowtie2: A Fast and Sensitive Read Alignment Tool
Introduction
Bowtie2 is a widely used open-source software tool designed for aligning sequencing reads to long reference genomes. It is optimized for speed and memory efficiency, making it ideal for high-throughput sequencing data such as those generated by Illumina platforms.

Key Features
Fast and memory-efficient: Uses a Burrows-Wheeler Transform (BWT) and FM-index for efficient alignment.
Supports paired-end and single-end reads.
Handles mismatches, indels, and gaps.
Local and global alignment modes.
Multithreading support for faster processing.
Outputs in SAM format (compatible with SAMtools).
Workflow
Indexing the Reference Genome
Before aligning, Bowtie2 builds an index of the reference genome:
bowtie2-build reference.fasta reference_index
command to run bowtie2
bowtie2 -x GRCh38_noalt_as/GRCh38_noalt_as \
     -1 fastp_output/ERR14218891_trimmed_R1.fastq.gz \
     -2 fastp_output/ERR14218891_trimmed_R2.fastq.gz \
     --un-conc-gz bowtie2_output/ERR14218891_nonhuman.fastq.gz \
     -S /dev/null -p 16
Explanation of Bowtie2 Command
The following table explains each option used in the Bowtie2 command:

Option / Argument	Description
bowtie2	The main program used for aligning sequencing reads to a reference genome.
-x GRCh38_noalt_as/GRCh38_noalt_as	Specifies the path and basename of the Bowtie2 index files for the reference genome (here, GRCh38 without alternative contigs).
-1 fastp_output/ERR14218891_trimmed_R1.fastq.gz	Input file containing paired-end forward reads (R1) after quality control and trimming with fastp.
-2 fastp_output/ERR14218891_trimmed_R2.fastq.gz	Input file containing paired-end reverse reads (R2) after quality control and trimming with fastp.
--un-conc-gz bowtie2_output/ERR14218891_nonhuman.fastq.gz	Writes pairs of reads that do not align to the reference genome into compressed FASTQ files. Output files will have suffixes .1 and .2 appended (e.g., ERR14218891_nonhuman.1.fastq.gz and ERR14218891_nonhuman.2.fastq.gz).
-S /dev/null	Directs the alignment output (SAM file) to /dev/null, effectively discarding it. This is useful when you only care about the unaligned reads and not the alignment itself.
-p 16	Runs Bowtie2 using 16 CPU threads in parallel, speeding up the alignment process.
Summary
This command aligns paired-end reads (R1 and R2) to the human reference genome (GRCh38_noalt_as). Instead of keeping the aligned reads, it discards them (-S /dev/null) and saves only the unaligned read pairs in compressed FASTQ format.
