📘 Why MetaOmics-ML?
![Uploading image.png…]()

Metagenomics can revolutionized our understanding of microbial communities. However, high-dimensional data and complex biological patterns often require advanced computational approaches.

🔹 Traditional bioinformatics pipelines can process and classify reads.
🔹 Machine learning can detect hidden patterns and classify disease states and generate actionable insights.

MetaOmics-ML bridges this gap by offering workflows that combine both worlds.
